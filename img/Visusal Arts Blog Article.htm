			<p>With a grand sense of adventure, Charles and Ray Eames turned their curiosity and boundless enthusiasm into creations that established them as a truly great husband and wife design team. Their unique synergy led to a whole new look in furniture. Lean and modern. Playful and functional. Sleek, sophisticated and beautifully simple. That was and is the "Eames look".

			<p>That look and their relationship with Herman Miller started with moulded plywood chairs in the late 1940s and included the world-renowned Eames lounge chair, now in the permanent collection of the Museum of Modern Art in New York
				</p>

			<p>Charles and Ray achieved their monumental success by approaching each project the same way: Does it interest and intrigue us? Can we make it better?

			<p>Their own concepts evloved over time, not overnight. As Charles noted about the 	
				development of the Moulded Plywood Chairs, "Yes, it was a flash of inspiration", he said, "a kind of 30-year flash".
